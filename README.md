##Douglas McCloskey

##Credits:

Ali Ebrahim for writing the original [sequtil](http://github.com/SBRG) library from which this is derived

To install, please follow the [instructions](INSTALL.md).

###Project Goals:
1.	Compilation of all open-source next generation sequencing packages in a single docker image for fast and pain-free deployment

2.	Methods to run analyses on large batches of samples utilizing docker containers

3.	Methods for distributing data across storage servers and compute servers utilizing docker containers

###TODO:

add/update .py __main__ to include all function parameters

modify shell scripts to call .py __main__

add docker_run scripts to run breseq using Docker
